## Data Nova: Transforming Big Data into Strategic Insights

The purpose of this project is to build a unified platform for marketing research, focused on big data analysis and mining from companies' social media platforms and user-generated content (UGC). The platform will automate the process of fetching and analyzing data from social media channels (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube) and review platforms (Amazon, Google Reviews, TripAdvisor, Booking.com). Using LLMs (Large Language Models), we will extract and analyze content such as product reviews, image captions, video transcripts, and key engagement metrics. The platform will also support hashtag-based searches and official social media handle identification using advanced AI models.
